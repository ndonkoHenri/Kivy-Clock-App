## Basic Clock and Chrono Application using Kivy/KivyMD

This application was built using [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) (a python framework for building cross-platform apps) and [KivyMD](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD) library.

The app's interface is quite simple and straight-forward for any user.

#### When executed, three main parts are observed:

- A digital clock (with the same time as the device running the program);
- A Stopwatch
- Two Buttons for the Stopwatch(a start/end Button and a reset button) both self-explanatory;


This App is still under development, and I will be opened to respond to any issue or checkout any pull-requests.

You can follow me or add a Watch to stay updated.
